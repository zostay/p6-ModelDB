v0.5.0	2019-10-22

    * Change default number of connections for connector to 1 just in case your
      client is not thread safe. Production applications, should there be any,
      should make sure their client library is thread safe and consider
      increasing this number to avoid contention.

v0.4.0	2019-10-13

    * Fixing time zone handling in DateTime loading. (This is a super-gross fix
      and probably a DBIish bug, but I'm fixing it the expedient way for the
      moment.)

v0.3.0	2019-10-11
    
    * Verison v6.d is required.

v0.2.1	2019-10-10

    * Rewrote the ModelDB::Connector so that is actually has a possibility of
      working. Actually, if this does prove workable, it will write my next blog
      post.

v0.2.0	2019-10-08

    * Added the ModelDB::Connector connection manager.

v0.1.1	2019-10-05
